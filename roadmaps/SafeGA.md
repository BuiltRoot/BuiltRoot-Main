# SafeGA Roadmap

## Current Phase
- UI/UX design for streamlined anesthesia risk stratification.
- Build medication database for standard IV regimens (midazolam, fentanyl, ketamine, ondansetron, dexamethasone, ketorolac, propofol) with dosing guidelines, risk flags, and tooltips.
- Integrate state-specific GA permit requirements, CE rules, emergency cart lists, and office anesthesia evaluation checklists.

## Next Milestones
1. Develop patient input form with system-based medication categorization.
2. Implement compliance module for state and AAOMS standards.
3. Add emergency protocol matching for each state.
4. Deploy CE tracker for GA-specific and general CE requirements.
5. Launch beta testing with pilot offices.

## Long-Term Goals
- Anonymous usage analytics (non-mandatory) for potential regulatory alignment.
- Expand medication options and emergency drug scenarios.
- Mobile app wrapper for offline use.
- API integration with DentalHire and other BuiltRoot platforms.
