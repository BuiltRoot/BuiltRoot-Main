# SafeSed Roadmap

## Current Phase
- UI/UX design for moderate sedation risk stratification with rapid patient input flow.
- Build medication database for moderate sedation agents with dosing, interactions, and risk flags.
- Integrate Washington Stateâ€™s moderate sedation rules and use them as a baseline for other states.
- Develop emergency cart list comparison for moderate sedation requirements across states.

## Next Milestones
1. Add state-by-state CE requirements for moderate sedation permit holders.
2. Implement emergency protocol and drill tracker specific to moderate sedation.
3. Launch CE upload and tracking module for sedation-specific and general CE.
4. Deploy medication card mockups with tooltips and visual dosing guides.
5. Conduct pilot testing with initial user group.

## Long-Term Goals
- Expand to cover pediatric moderate sedation.
- Include optional mock ACLS and IV sedation drills with rhythm identification and airway management scenarios.
- Mobile app wrapper for offline usability.
- Integration with CE providers for auto-verification of course completion.
